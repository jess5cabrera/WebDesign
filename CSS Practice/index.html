        <h1> Description of my activities </h2>
        
        <p> I enjoy alot of things mostly I enjoy being comfortable around my house. I mean who doesn't. Usually when I am extremely bored I like to do my make up and dress up. I also like to sew a few pieces of clothing that may fit too big an resize them. During the nights I either find myself doing homework or watching a movie. I have also been experimenting with dying my hair and brows which is really fun and I really enjoy it. Last binge I did was Game of Thrones, ah what a great show. Lastly, I really want to get into sketching and drawing but haven't really had the time or mental preparation to put my pencil against a sheet of paper. I really want to be able to make cool art and sketches.</p>
